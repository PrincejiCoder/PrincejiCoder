# Hey There 👋.

I'm  [**Prince**](https://github.com/PrincejiCoder) a **CST developer** and **builder** based in **India**.

I chose CST so I could have the technical freedom to build whatever I can imagine. If any idea pops into my head, I build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is **React, Node.js, and Python**. 

I have over **100 public repositories**, but my private labs hold **over 200** projects where I experiment with new logic and tools. My favorite build so far is my **AI-Powered Learning-Diagnostic-Agent**.

### Fun Facts:

* **Favorite Read:** *The Mech Touch*.
* **Workflow:** VS Code, Notion, and Git.
* **Languages:** C, C++, and Python.
* **Source:** I learn by building and spending hours on YouTube and documentation.
